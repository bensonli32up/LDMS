Here are several enhancements I am considering to improve functionality, security, usability, and scalability:

1.Logging Improvements: This involves logging user actions, system errors, and performance metrics to aid in debugging and monitoring.

2.Validation and Exception Handling: Enhance input validation beyond basic annotations. Custom validators may be needed to handle complex validation requirements. Improve exception handling to provide more informative error messages to API consumers and log detailed error information for troubleshooting purposes.

3.Unexpected Input Handling: There is no handling for unexpected input, for example: max number of payment that use can input.

4.Security Implementation: Introduce authentication and authorization mechanisms for accessing the api. And also when someone creates a record, it will also be stored in the database, along with information about who created it and when.

5.User Interface: Redesign the web-based UI for improved usability and visual appeal.

6.Data Store Migration: Consider migrating to a more robust data store such as PostgreSQL or MySQL to enhance performance and scalability.

7.Paging Implementation: Introduce paging functionality for the "Get All Amortization Schedules" API endpoint to manage large datasets more effectively.
